# Design and implementation of a cloud-based service for remote monitoring of IoT devices

The entire project was developed using all open-source technologies to reduce costs and increase the portability of the service to other cloud platforms.

### Overview
Our project aims to help a common user in viewing and analyzing data related to their smart home. It contains time readings on different appliances in a house, combined with data on weather conditions. We will illustrate the graphs and techniques used to extract visual information from the data set, discussing the purpose of the methods we used and the choices we made.
